- **Host App Compatibility**:
  Supports macOS, Windows, and Linux, with Android support in development.

- **Plug-and-Play Convenience**:
  Instant control upon connection, with no software installation or configuration on the target device. Leaves no software traces on the target computer.

- **Network Independence**:
  Stable and fast headless control via HDMI and emulated keyboard/mouse (HID) input.

- **Ultra-Portable Design**:
  Its compact and lightweight design makes it the perfect tool for professionals on the go.

- **Full HD with Low Latency**:
  Supported output video up to 1920x1080@30Hz with under 140 milliseconds of latency. Adaptable to VGA, Micro HDMI, DVI, and other inputs with a video adapter.

- **Audio Integration**:
  Captures and plays the target device's audio directly on the host computer.

- **BIOS-Level Access**:
  Provides direct access to the target device's BIOS, firmware, or startup management.

- **Switchable USB Type-A Port**:
  This allows you to toggle USB access between the host and the target, ideal for sharing a USB drive without replugging. Check out our [Switchable USB Port](/usb-switch) page for more information.

- **Text Transfer**:
  The text transfer functionality allows you to send text from the host computer to the target device. This feature emulates typing behaviour to reproduce text content on the target computer, ideal for copying usernames, passwords, or code snippets.
  
    - **Special Characters**: The text transfer feature supports various ASCII characters, including symbols, punctuation marks, and non-alphanumeric characters.

    - **Limited Text**: It is ideal to transfer a short test like username, long password, code snippets from the host to the target. You can transfer text of varying lengths, but it is not recommended to transfer too much text at one time to avoid potential issues.

!!! warning "Limitations of Text Transfer Feature"

    - **No Clipboard Integration**: The text transfer feature is designed to emulate typing behaviour and cannot transfer non-textual content, such as images or formatted text.
    - **Language Limitations**: This feature exclusively supports transferring text based on ASCII codes and does not support languages that are not ASCII-based, such as Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters.
