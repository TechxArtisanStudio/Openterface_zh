# Comparison

## **How is this Mini-KVM different from KVM-over-IP?**

1. **Network Independence**: Our Openterface mini-KVM uses a direct USB connection for control, whereas KVM-over-IP relies on network connectivity, which requires extra effort and time to set up for new target devices.
2. **Stable Performance**: Mini-KVM offers fast and stable performance without being affected by network quality, in contrast to KVM-over-IP, which can be impacted by network speed and stability.
3. **Portability**: The Mini-KVM is designed for portability and ease of use with nearby headless devices, making it better to deal with uncertain situations where network access is limited or unavailable.
4. **Direct File Transfer**: The Mini-KVM supports stable file transfers between the host and target devices through a switchable USB-A port with plugging in a usb stick. This is a feature that might not be as straightforward with some KVM-over-IP solutions.
6. **Target Audience**: Mini-KVM is particularly suitable for tech enthusiasts and IT professionals who require a quick and reliable solution for configuring or troubleshooting nearby headless devices, whereas KVM-over-IP is often used in environments with a stable network where remote access over IP is a priority.

## **How is this different from traditional KVM solutions?**

1. **Portability:** The Openterface Mini-KVM is designed for portability, making it ideal for tech enthusiasts and IT professionals who need a compact solution. It looks cool and small enough to throw into your backpack. Traditional KVM switches tend to be larger and suited for stationary setups for 24/7 operation. 
2. **Control Mechanism and Integration:** Traditional KVM switches use pure hardware-based switching mechanisms, allowing control of only one computer at a time. In contrast, the Openterface Mini-KVM combines hardware and software, enabling the control of both the host and target devices through a single interface on the host computer or host laptop. This integrated approach facilitates seamless switching between host and target at the app window level, significantly improving workflow efficiency.
3. **Functionality:** While the Openterface Mini-KVM focuses on 1-to-1 direct control over USB and HDMI video capture, traditional KVM switches may offer a wider range of functionalities including multi-device control via USB, VGA, DVI, HDMI, audio support, and sometimes even remote access capabilities over the network.
4. **Power Supply:** the mini-KVM does not require an external power supply, as it is designed to be powered through its USB-C connections from the host, enhancing its portability. Traditional KVMs are sationary solutions that need extra power supply.
