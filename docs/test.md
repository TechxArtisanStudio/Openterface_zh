- **Port Compatibility**: Ensure the USB-A 2.0 port supports various USB devices like flash drives and webcams.
- **Power Limitations**: Confirm the port‚Äôs power supply capacity and its adequacy for different devices.

## üîå Plug & Un-Plug

- **Connection Testing**: Test scenarios with different connection and disconnection sequences.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure device recognises and recovers from improper connections.
- **Stability**: Verify stability when devices are plugged and unplugged repeatedly.

## üìù Text Transfer

- **Functionality Testing**: Verify that the host application can successfully transfer text from the host computer to the target device using ASCII codes.

- **Content Integrity**: Ensure the text content transferred from the host to the target device remains intact and is accurately reproduced.

- **Special Characters Handling**: Test the text transfer feature with various ASCII characters to ensure proper handling and reproduction on the target device.

- **Text Length Testing**: Test the text transfer feature with text of varying lengths to verify that it can accommodate different text sizes without issues.

- **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios, such as loss of connection or interruption during text transfer, to ensure the host application handles these situations gracefully and provides appropriate feedback to the user.

- **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the performance of the text transfer feature under various conditions, including on older or slower computers, to identify any potential issues with mis-receiving HID input signals and ensure smooth operation.

- **User Interface Testing**: Ensure the user interface of the host application provides intuitive controls and feedback for initiating and monitoring text transfer operations, making it easy for users to understand and use this feature effectively.

## Additional
